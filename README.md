# Group20

This repository has three folders. One for each part. They are all in main branch because this way if we make changes to several of them we don't have to try to figure out which versions are compatible with each other. They come in a package so if a change in one program requires a change another the compatible versions should be in the same package. We are trying to build a database, server and client who all have to work together after all.

ATMFrontEnd can be opened with qt creator. Maybe we will also include binaries. Why not?

ATMBackEnd is the server the front end connects to and is coden in PHP.

ATMMySQL is our database that is the foundation for everything.
